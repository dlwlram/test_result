The coordinate of the point is calculated by the surface equation. The surface equation is usually a function of the surface parameter u and v. The function is calculated by the surface equation function. The surface equation function is usually defined in the part file. The surface equation function is called by the surface equation function. The coordinate of the point is calculated by the surface equation function.
